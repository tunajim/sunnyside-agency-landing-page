## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This was a good practice in using HTML and CSS to layout a simple static webpage.  It was a helpful practice for understanding how click events work with JavaScript.  Often times the correct element will not be targeted when clicked, so it is necessary to control which elements have pointer events.  

This project introduced me to using responsive images via the img tag and srcset/sizes attributes.
